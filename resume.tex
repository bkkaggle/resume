\cvsubsection{L2}[May to June 2020]
[Fast, BLAS-accelerated machine learning library][\url{https://github.com/bkkaggle/L2}]

\begin{itemize}
    \item Wrote a fast and efficient machine learning library in the Rust programming language.
    \item Supports numpy-style multidimensional arrays and array operations, BLAS-accelerated matrix multiplication, and a graph-based automatic differentiation engine.
\end{itemize}

\cvsubsection{NLP Research Project}[March to May 2020]
[Replicated GPT-2][\url{https://github.com/bkkaggle/lm-training-research-project}]

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pretrained OpenAI's 124M parameter GPT-2 language model to generate convincing human-like text.
    \item Used the Google Cloud Platform with PyTorch and Tensorflow to scale the model to a 128-core TPUv3 Pod. 
    \item Worked on developing and pretraining a new, more efficient ALBERT-style language model.
\end{itemize}
